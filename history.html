    <h1>The history of FC BARCELONA</h1>
    <p>Even before they changed the football landscape by inventing the tiki-taka style of play, 
        FC Barcelona have been known for their likable and highly watchable brand of football that always seemed to produce results. 
        During their long and immensely successful history, they have won tons of La Liga titles as well as Copa del Rey trophies, 
        to which can be added Champions Leagues and Cup Winners' Cups. As one of the richest and most popular clubs in the world, 
        they can afford to be owned and financed exclusively by their own supporters. Since its inception, Barcelona has been a major 
        symbol of Catalonia and its culture, as evidenced by its motto, which says “More than a club” (Més que un club).</p>

         <h3>Basic Facts</h3>
         <p>In 1899, football pioneer Joan Gamper decided he wanted to form a football club.
             After eleven other enthusiasts responded to his newspaper advert, 
             the dream became a reality and Barcelona was born.<br>
             Even though Barcelona made the history books by becoming the first team to defeat Real Madrid in the European Cup,
              the 60s as a whole were largely a disappointing time for the club's supporters.<br> With Di Stefano in his prime, 
              Real Madrid was simply too strong of an opponent and Barcelona had to settle with two Copa del Rey trophies for the decade. 
              Ironically, this would prove to be a common theme in the coming years.</p>
